# Sudoku

In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 

The Sudoku provided here always shows several solutions (max. 10), if several solutions are available.

There is also the option of playing X-Sudoku, in which the diagonals must also be taken into account in addition to the above-mentioned requirements.
