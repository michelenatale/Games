# Sudoku

In classic Sudoku, the aim is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that make up the grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9.

A new game can be created at any time using the "New Sudoku" button.

If the difficulty level is changed, a new Sudoku game is also created. The same applies if the game is switched to XSudoku.

You can use the "Solution" Button to generate all solutions (max. 10 puzzles) from the existing Sudoku game.

With the "Sudoku Solver" Button you can create your own Sudoku. It is also possible here to use the "Solution" Button if all solutions are to be solved.

The Sudoku offered here offers the possibility to play with 6 levels of difficulty. It is also possible to play X-Sudoku, in which the diagonals must also be taken into account in addition to the requirements mentioned above.

Depending on the game status, several solutions can be generated. The Sudoku offered here offers a maximum of 10 solutions, as long as 10 solutions are still possible.


### Start a new game
There are 3 ways to start a new game. Via the ComboBox (new level of difficulty), via the CheckBox (select XSudoku) or via the "New Sudoku" Button.
