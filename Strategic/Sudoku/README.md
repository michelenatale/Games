# Sudoku

In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 

The Sudoku provided here always shows several solutions (max. 10), if several solutions are available.

There is also the option of playing X-Sudoku, in which the diagonals must also be taken into account in addition to the above-mentioned requirements.

A new game can be created at any time using the "New Sudoku" button. 

If the difficulty level is changed, a new Sudoku game is also created. The same applies if the game is changed to XSudoku.

The "Solution" button can be used to generate the solutions (max. 10 puzzles) from the existing Sudoku game.

The "Sudoku Solver" button can be used to create your own Sudoku. And here, too, it is possible to use the "Solution" button if all solutions are to be deleted.
